# DebPi
Playbooks to bootstrap my Raspberry Pi stack. 4 nodes, leader acts as DHCP host.

This is work in progress, but master branch can always be used without problems.

### Ease of setup
For me, the most time consuming aspect of resetting my pi-cluster is having to manually setup the ssh access permission, and sudoers file.
I've done some cmd-line voodo to bypass this, which naturally introduces some potential security concerns if you're running a Pi in production. 

## Architecture
Coming soon....
